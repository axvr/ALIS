# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

* **Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of Conduct.**
* Everyone will have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want within the project.
* Authority or positions within the project must be earned.
* Trolling and harassment is not tolerated.
* Software is constantly evolving; the better implementations will always supersede the lesser implementations.
* Non technical conflicts should be discussed in a separate place.
* Individual characteristics of a person, are irrelevant in the scope of the project, and will not be taken into account concerning value or that of contribution to the project.
* Discussions must only consist of debate over the idea addressed, and not the person that addressed it.
* If something is illegal outside the scope of the project, it is illegal in the scope of the project.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of any individual characteristics or experience.

### Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 * Public or private harassment
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the [project team](mailto:axvr@bitmessage.ch). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant v1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4) and the [Code of Merit v1.0](http://code-of-merit.org/).
