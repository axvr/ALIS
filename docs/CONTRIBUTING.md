## How to Contribute to Archaic

There are many ways to contribute to Archaic, (you don't need to know how to write code to contribute).

### Bug Reports

If you find any bugs please submit them as an issue to the [Archaic GitHub page](https://github.com/axvr/archaic/issues) (Note, you will have to be signed into your GitHub account). Please mark the bugs with the ```bug``` label and all other appropriate labels, and give as much information as possible as to your error/bug, including how to reproduce the error.

When `start.pl` is run a file named `archaic.log` will be created and filled in depending upon specific run circumstances, please submit the entirety of the log file when submitting a a bug report.

Make sure that you submit issues in **English only**.

### Enhancement Suggestions

Enhancements are similar to a bug report, but use the `enhancement` label instead of the `bug` label, as well as all other appropriate labels.

Again, **English only**.

### Translation

Archaic is looking to gain multi-language support, if you can do translations of the text within Archaic please submit it as an issue to the [Archaic GitHub issue page](https://github.com/axvr/archaic/issues) with the `enhancement` tag.

The translations will be checked to avoid any trolling.
