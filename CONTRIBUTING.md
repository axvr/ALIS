## How to Contribute to ALIS

There are many ways to contribute to ALIS, (you don't need to know how to write code to contribute).

### Bug Reports

If you find any bugs please submit them as an issue to the [ALIS GitHub page](https://github.com/axvr/alis/issues) (Note, you will have to be signed into your GitHub account). Please mark the bugs with the ```bug``` label and all other appropriate labels, and give as much information as possible as to your error/bug, including how to reproduce the error.

When ```start.pl``` is run a file named ```alis.log``` will be created and filled in depending upon specific run circumstances, please submit the entirety of the log file when submitting a a bug report.

Make sure that you submit issues in **English only**.

### Enhancement Suggestions

If you have any suggestions on how to improve ALIS submit an enhancement on the [ALIS issue page on GitHub](https://github.com/axvr/alis/issues).

Enhancements are similar to a bug report, but use the ```enhancement``` label instead of the ```bug``` label, as well as all other appropriate labels.

Again, **English only**.

### Translation

ALIS is looking to gain multi-language support, if you can do translations of the text within ALIS please submit it as an issue to the [ALIS GitHub issue page](https://github.com/axvr/alis/issues) with the ```enhancement``` tag.

The translations will be checked to avoid any trolling.
