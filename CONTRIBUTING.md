## Contributor Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 * Public or private harassment
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at axvr[at]bitmessage[dot]ch. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4).

## How to Contribute to ALIS

There are many ways to contribute back to ALIS, you don't heed to be a programmer just to contribute.

### Bug Reports

If you find any bugs please submit them as an issue to the ALIS GitLab page: [https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues](https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues) (Note you will have to be signed into a GitLab account). Please mark the bugs with the ``Bug Fixes`` label and all other appropriate labels, and give as much information as possible as to your error/bug, including how to reproduce the error.

When ``start.pl`` is run a file named ``alis.log`` will be created and filled in depending upon specific run circumstances, please submit the entirety of the log file when submitting a a bug report.

Make sure that you submit issues in **English only**.

### Enhancement Suggestions

If you have any suggestions on how to improve ALIS submit an enhancement here: [https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues](https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues).

Enhancements are similar to a bug report, but use the ``Enhancements`` label instead of the ``Bug Fixes`` label, as well as all other appropriate labels.

Again, **English only**.

### Translation

ALIS is looking to gain multi-language support, if you can do translations of the text within ALIS please submit it as an issue to [https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues](https://gitlab.com/axvr/alis/issues).

The translations will be checked to avoid any trolling.

#### Code of Coding

Taken from [https://gitlab.com/CartesianDuelist/CodeOfCoding](https://gitlab.com/CartesianDuelist/CodeOfCoding).

1. The chief duty of the project participants is to contribute to its continued development,
stability, usability and efficiency. Participants will be evaluated the basis of these contributions. 

2. Contributions will be judged on primarily/solely the basis of their value to the project,
either by their introduction and implementation of useful and needed featuresets and solutions, 
superiority over existing ones, or refinement of those already existent. 

3. Individual characteristics, both immutable and chosen, as well as actions undertaken or views 
expressed outside of the project's official channels are immaterial to the project's scope 
and thus also immaterial under considerations of participants' value or their contributions to the project. 
Attempts to bring them to the project's forefront are anathema to the project's primary goals, 
the duties of its contributors, and the underpinnings of this Code.

4. The project creators/lead developers/core team are the overseers of the 
project and have ultimate decision-making power over the project in all respects they choose, 
be they technical, structural, organizational, personal, or otherwise. Should participants disagree 
with their actions and decisions, forking is welcomed if available. 

5. Actions that can, under a reasonable standard, be likely to damage a contributor's well-being, 
employment, or personal relations have no place within the project or its communication channels. 

6. By contributing to the project, participants agree to follow this Code in both letter
and in spirit of the perusal of meritocracy embodied herein. 

**In a nutshell: Write good code that doesn't suck, leave politics and personal issues at the door.**
